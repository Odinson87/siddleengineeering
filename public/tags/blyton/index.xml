      <description>The Siddle Engineering Toyota Celica T Sport has made its debut in the Toyota Sprint Series, where it met with tough competition. A fifth placed finish was respectable for the only car in the entire competition on stock suspension. An important learning curve, this event has highlighted several areas to improve on.
 The car features cooling system components designed by Siddle Engineering and sourced through a local OEM parts supplier and is to target the TSS along with the British Hillclimb Championship this season.</description>
